# rise-of-the-ai
use the arrows keys to move and jump around. Running into an enemy kills the player. 
There are four ways to kill an enemy. 
- Landing on top of an enemy
- Having the enemy land on top of the player
- Press space key and have a time restricted shuriken to the left of the player (can only be used once)
- Enemy falls off into the void. 
You win once all three enemies have been defeated.
You lose if you get killed. 
The leftmost enemy will detect you within a certain range and walk and jump towards you.
The bottom enemy will charge towards you, rest, then charge again.
The rightmost enemy will walk towards you wherever you are.

NOTE **** Known bugs: For some reason, if the player stands still and the enemy touches the player, the player will teleport to the top of the enemy and kill the enemy. Happens the most with the charging minion.****
